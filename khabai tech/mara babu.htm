	<h1>Mele babu ne thana thaya</h1>
	<p>Mele babu ne thana thaya is a resturent inspired by nibba nibbis from our local area
		Nibba and Nibbi are young love birds (only they think). Many teenagers who pretend to be in love and share there feeling in Social Media Platforms by posting love status and their emotions towards others.

So whenever we see a under aged boy and girl hanging out each other we call them as Nibba and Nibbi, for others we call as Love Birds.

Nowadays these two characters trending in social media because many teenagers are behaving that they can't leave without their partners.

So. Nibba NIBBIES are not safe on street in our area so we decided to make a resturant where they can feel secure and enjoy there meal 

We further decided to open a new hotel like oyo but only nibba NIBBIES can come there 

Our payment option will be cash by nibba and gpay by nibbi</p></div>
